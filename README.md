This is repository for my blog posts. It uses Jekyll with Github Pages and is forked from [Jekyll-now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I have added the following additional features

1. Follow me on twitter button below the site description
2. A share widget for sharing the post on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus
3. A new field in front-matter named `excerpt` which is used to display a summary of post on the home page

Head to [http://chatekar.com](http://chatekar.com) to view the blog.

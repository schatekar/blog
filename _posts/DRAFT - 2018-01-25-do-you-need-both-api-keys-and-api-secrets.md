title: "Do you need both API keys and API secrets?"

Years ago, when I built my first public API, I had this dilemma - should I use both an API key and a secret to protect my API or just one of them is enough? I didn't do a lot of research and went ahead with the simple option to use an API key. I cannot say whether that was a right or wrong decision, as with anything in software, the answer is - it depends. But I remember having taken extreme care in making sure that the key does not get leaked on it's way to the intended recipient. Since then I have consumed many APIs that used combination of API key and secret.

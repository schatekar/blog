This "Loyalty on Blockchain" offering mainly comes in two flavours. The first one is a universal loyalty currency. This is similar to a traditional coalition programme except for the fact that the loyalty currency is managed using Blockchain. A lot has been said about [why such programmes do not work](http://blog.kobie.com/2018/03/blockchain-technology-and-cryptocurrency-are-two-very-different-things-be-sure-not-to-confuse-them/) but that is not the point of this article. The second flavour allows the brands to create their own currency in the form of an [ERC20 Ethereum Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20) which is a slightly advanced form of a crypto-currency. 

Both types of programmes make a bold claim that traditional loyalty programmes can significantly reduce their liability by converting to these programmes. Universal loyalty currency is just another crypto-currency like Bitcoin or Ether. Holder of a universal loyalty currency can sell her holdings in exchange for other crypto-currency on any of the registered exchanges. This is besides the point that such currency can also be spent at other participating brands.

## There is an inherent chicken-and-egg problem in this proposition

Members of a loyalty programme can sell the currency to anyone in an open market only when there are buyers for this currency.

This is a series of blog posts on my random thoughts on load testing. I am not expert in the field of load testing. But I have worked on a number of load testing projects of all sizes, I have the pleasure of working with some of the best in the field and I personally have huge interest in this area. I have seen that some of the very useful and interesting load testing ideas do not get much talked about and practiced. If you may have come across these before, or you may these intimately. But if you have not, hope you find these posts useful

## There is more you can do with open source that just using it

We all use open source day in, day out. But have you ever wondered that there are more things you can do with open source than just using it? 

You can, of course, contribute to open source. But that is not what I am talking about. That needs discipline and commitment that not everyone of us can manage to have all the time. What I am talking about is __Learning from Open Source__. I have been learning a lot of things from various open source projects for some time. I have realised that the open source can be the teacher we need and the mentor we seek. 

So what do you learn from the open source and how do you do it?

## #1. How do document your code for the consumers of your library/API/function?
Documentation is as much an art as it is a skill. It takes more than just the mastery over a language to produce the best, most updated and effective documentation. To add to that, this cat can be skinned in many different ways, each way being the most suitable for a different documentation use case. As developers, we come across so much of great documentation every day. If we stop and take a moment to find answers to the following questions, then we can give the consumers of our library/API/functions the same satisfaction that we get when we read that great documentation of an open source project. 

1. What tools are used to product the consumable/discoverable documentation from the raw text?
2. What processes are followed to ensure that the documentation never goes out of date?
3. How are documentation for different versions of the same library are maintained?
4. What different features are used to make the documentation more interactive? e.g. runnable code samples, interactive tutorials etc. 
5. How is documentation organised? e.g. by consumer's familiarity of the topic, natural order to learn something, short vs long tutorials etc. 

I am not saying that you can get answers to these questions by simply looking at the documentation of the project. Well, in some cases you do. But you will mostly be expected to go through contribution guidelines, review comments on pull requests or even interact with maintainers. 

## #2. Established patterns and practices
I still remember my first nodejs application and all the difficulty I had in adjusting to the new world order. Coming from .NET background, I understood how MVC pattern worked, but I was finding it difficult get my head around the fact that people write stable, production grade web application using a framework like [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/). The examples in the documentation looked so incomplete. I never understood how people wrote clean readable code in JavaScript. I never took off properly. 

One day, I was looking to move my blog from wordpress to something that supported markdown. I came across [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) which was proudly advertised as being built using Node and Express. This piqued my interest. I went over to GitHub to look at their source code.

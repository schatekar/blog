This is part 2 of [Bitcoin Pub Analogy](http://chatekar.com/Bitcoin-Pub-Analogy/). I wrote it as an extension of that post but you do not have to read that post, in order to understand this. Read still if you fancy. 

So, onto bringing it back home. What I want to do with this post is take away the analogy element and explain in the most simple terms how bitcoin actually works. While, I am doing that, I would try to keep the same story line so it helps the folks who have read the pub analogy.

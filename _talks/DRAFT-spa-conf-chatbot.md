## Abstract:

It is the most exciting time for technology. We are seeing radical transformation in almost everything we do. The most exciting is the rise of natural language interfaces. Devices like Alexa and Google Home are letting you interact with appliances and services using natural language. More and more businesses are responding to customers using bots. Ever wondered how it all works? 

Come to this session where I will open the bonnet to show you how fundamental building blocks of a bot (chat or voice) work. I will explain the basic concepts like intents, entities and then show you how to use these to build meaningful dialogue using Watson Conversation. Watson conversation is one of the many bot services available on the market. Once the basics are clear, I will show you how to build a simple bot front-end by integrating with Watson Conversation APIs. We will end the session with a fully functional chatbot with a simple conversation model.
